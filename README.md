# IMDb-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview
 Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining
 whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, we will
 analyze movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and predict the sentiment (positive or
 negative) based on the text of the reviews. By leveraging various text preprocessing
 techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, this project will
 develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie
 reviews. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for movie producers, critics,
 and platforms like IMDb to understand public opinion and tailor marketing or content
 strategies accordingly.

 ## Problem Statement
  The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that
 can predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews. The dataset contains a collection of movie
 reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

 ## Dataset Information
 The IMDb dataset contains a large number of movie reviews, each labeled with either a
 positive or negative sentiment.
